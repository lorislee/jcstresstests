/*
 * This is our first concurrency test. It is deliberately simplistic to show testing approaches,
 * introduce JCStress APIs, etc.
 * 
 * Suppose we want to see if the field increment is atomic. We can make test with two actors, both
 * actors incrementing the field and recording what value they observed into the result object. As
 * JCStress runs, it will invoke these methods on the objects holding the field once per each actor
 * and instance, and record what results are coming from there.
 * 
 * Done enough times, we will get the history of observed results, and that would tell us something
 * about the concurrent behavior. For example, running this test would yield:
 * 
 * [OK] ConcurrencyTest (JVM args: [-server]) Observed state Occurrences Expectation Interpretation
 * 1, 1 54,734,140 ACCEPTABLE Both threads came up with the same value: atomicity failure. 1, 2
 * 47,037,891 ACCEPTABLE actor1 incremented, then actor2. 2, 1 53,204,629 ACCEPTABLE actor2
 * incremented, then actor1.
 * 
 * How to run this test: $ java -jar jcstresstests/target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest
